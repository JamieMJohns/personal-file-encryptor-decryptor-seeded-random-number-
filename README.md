# personal-file-encryptor-decryptor-with-seeded-random-number-
test python program i made which encrypts encoding of files in a specified folder (output file types are ".jim" files) after user specifies seed (number) for random number generator ... the ".jim" files can then be decrypted with same program (and converted back to original file type) if user inputs correct random number seed that was used to encrypt files.  
  
When I have time, I will update the repository with more indepth description but for; refer to comments in .py code
for understand how program works.  

<repository to be updated soon>
